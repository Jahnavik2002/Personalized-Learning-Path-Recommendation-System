Project Motivation
In today's diverse educational landscape, a one-size-fits-all approach to learning often limits students' potential. The Personalized Learning Path Recommendation System aims to address this by crafting individualized learning journeys. By using data-driven algorithms, this system considers each learner’s strengths, weaknesses, and preferences to provide recommendations that enhance learning outcomes and foster an engaging educational experience.

Features
User Profile Creation: Track and store individual user preferences, learning styles, and performance metrics.
Learning Style Classification: Determine each user’s learning style based on their interactions and preferences.
Path Recommendations: Generate personalized learning paths with recommended resources, activities, and assessments.
Progress Tracking: Monitor user progress to adjust recommendations as users advance through their learning paths.
User Interface: A dashboard to display recommended resources, track progress, and adjust preferences.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
Libraries:
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and handling.
Scikit-Learn: For classification and recommendation algorithms.
TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning for advanced recommendation algorithms.
Flask/Django: Web framework for building a user-friendly interface.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Database:
MySQL/PostgreSQL: Storing user data and learning paths.
Frontend:
HTML/CSS & JavaScript: Building the interactive dashboard.
React/Angular (Optional): For a dynamic and responsive frontend.
Data Description
The system uses a dataset with user information, including demographic details, historical learning data, and performance scores. Additionally, each learning resource is tagged with metadata (e.g., difficulty level, topic, estimated completion time) to help tailor recommendations.

Key Attributes:
User Profiles: Contains details on each user’s learning style, previous performance, and preferences.
Learning Resources: Metadata for each resource to aid in selection for learning paths.
Progress Metrics: Tracks user progress and performance for iterative improvement.
